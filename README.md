# MigrationEngine
Some interfaces and a simple engine to perform db migrations with an SQLServer implementation

I was using [DbUp](http://dbup.github.io/), but I needed something simpler and more customizable, so I built this.

Use if you want. Should be simple enough to just copy the code and modify it as needed
